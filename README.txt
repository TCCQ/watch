This is a linux hotkey script written in C. I wanted to make something to execute arbitrary commands on an arbitrary keypress, without having to have an X server running. Its a little clunky, but it works. It requires root, as it directly reads the /dev/input/event* for your keyboard, so keep that in mind. It also ignores other processes grabbing the keyboard. Do not chmod the event file, that would allow anybody who tries to read everything you type, passwords and all. You will probably also need to change where the path to the event for your keyboard if you steal this. Don't look forward to any updates, but it could happen.
